This project focuses on detecting and classifying forest fires using satellite imagery processed through Google Earth Engine. The dataset comprises satellite images clipped from forest regions in parts of Africa and California, derived from USGS Landsat 9 and SRTM DEM (30m resolution) data. The processed images contain nine spectral and topographic bands (Red, Green, Blue, NDVI, NDWI, BAI, NBR, Slope, and Aspect), while the target variable is the VIIRS thermal anomaly (275m resolution), resampled to 30m using bilinear transformation. The dataset is divided into 256Ã—256 patches using Patchify to enhance training efficiency.

The model is built using a Multi-Class U-Net architecture, optimized for pixel-wise segmentation of fire-affected regions. It follows an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, utilizing Conv2D layers with ReLU activation, dropout (0.2) for regularization, and transposed convolutions for upsampling. The Jaccard Coefficient (IoU-based loss function) ensures accurate segmentation by optimizing overlap between predicted and actual fire regions. This multi-class model differentiates between varying fire intensities, smoke, and unaffected areas, making it an effective tool for real-time wildfire detection and prevention. The approach is scalable, computationally efficient, and highly accurate, enabling proactive wildfire monitoring and mitigation strategies.
